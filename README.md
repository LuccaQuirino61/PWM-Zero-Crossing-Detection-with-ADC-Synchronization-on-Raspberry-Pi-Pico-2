# PWM-Zero-Crossing-Detection-with-ADC-Synchronization-on-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-2
This project demonstrates how to precisely trigger an ADC reading when a PWM signal reaches zero on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It ensures accurate synchronization between the PWM carrier and ADC sampling, making it useful for power electronics applications, motor control, and PLL implementations.
